I chose to use Java programming language to develop this project because I am most familar with Java and I found it easy to use. 

Make sure you have the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. Before running, you will need to compile the java source file. To do this, type 'javac *.java' After compiling, run the program by typing 'java project02'

Observations:
Doves will steadily increase their resources and never lose any. Only the lucky Hawks will increase their resource faster than Doves. Unlucky Hawks will either struggle to increase their resource or die. If there is an odd number of hawks in the simulation, then at least one hawk will eventually survive and easily rise above the doves, making that Hawk the top of the food chain. If there are a small percentage of hawks in the simulation, hawks will most likely be in the top. Also, if the hawk-hawk cost is smaller than or equal to the resource amount, hawk will rise to the top easily, but if cost is very high compared to resource amount, hawks will really struggle to reach to the top 
In general case, I think that Dove is the ESS in the simulation if there are no hawks or even-numbered hawks with a high hawk-hawk cost because if there is an even-numbered hawks in the game, then those hawks will die and only animals left in the simulation are doves and they will be guaranteed to have payoff on every encounter.
